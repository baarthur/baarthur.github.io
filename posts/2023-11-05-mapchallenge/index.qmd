I have known the 30 day map challenge for two years now, but I was always too shy to join it. But the whole point is to have fun and learn something along the way, so here I am! I will update this post daily with my maps and the link to the code on my [github repo](https://github.com/baarthur/mapchallenge-2023/tree/main). I missed the first two days, so I'm starting from day 3.



## Day three: polygons

I spent some five hours making this, and I sadly lost my original code because I was stupid enought to not save the file. Accidents happen, so always save your files! Fortunately, I was at a loose end enough to recreate it. 

The inspiration for this came from this tweet from `@_palenrique`, where he compared Brazil's Federal District size to other huge metropolitan areas.

The biggest challenge was how to get all metropolitan areas in the same scale. I had a notion that I should use `coord_sf()` in my `ggplot` to make them all in the same frame, but I just did not know how to get a bounding box with the same widths for the different regions. Then I had an idea: what if I calculate a buffer from the region's centroid to the bounding box limit and use this constant ratio to create a buffer & a bounding box for each city?

Anyways, here it is!

This version is actually a little better than the original one, which you can still find on [twitter](https://twitter.com/baarthur0/status/1720592766479069266).



## Day four: a bad map!

Whenever I think of a bad map, three things come to my mind: clumsy information, bad colors, and the amazing [@TerribleMaps](https://twitter.com/TerribleMaps) twitter page. Then I thought, what can be both totally useful and disturbing at the same time? The answer was on my face: I've always been fascinated by how my home state of Minas Gerais looks like a face with a big nose and booger coming out of it, so I manually created a list of cities for each feature and `ggplot`ed it.

Later on, I found out that [gaga stans really liked it](https://twitter.com/MazettiMiguel/status/1720842936793841979). I had no idea they had an internal joke about her!



## Day five: an analog map

Okay, I'm assuming this means I use no digital thing to make this, am I right? Since a kid/pre-teen I have always loved to draw maps, especially during boring classes in school. So that's what I did, but this time using fountain pains! 

I tried it five times before my final version. I ended up starting by Minas Gerais... And it says a lot that Minas is bigger than Amazonas on my map! Perhaps we increase the things we have a better grasp. I'm so used to Minas and the Southeast that all I can say is sorry for my terrible borders. At least I got all states and capitals right...

## Day six: Asia

So an Asia map... What can i do that's still related to what I know? Also, I'm very tired. So I just looked for trade values for 1997 and 2022 to see how imports & exports evolved between time and between countries. The scale was a hell of a nightmare as always, but I think this looks quite okay!

## Day seven: a navigation map

Being a transportation nerd, today's quest is my favorite! I had no doubt and took my animated map for the SÃ£o Paulo rapid transit network, now with a few tweaks. 

To summarize what I did: I have a dataframe with the innauguration date for each line and station. Although being different geometries, lines and stations need to be in the same `data.frame` for this to work, so you need to compatibilize them beforehand. Then, all you need to do is use `gganimate` and to make all stations persist in time, add `shadow_mark()`.
